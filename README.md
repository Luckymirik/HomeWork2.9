Educational project. Spring

Your task for today is to write a service that collects a shopping cart for an online store.
Send the completed task to the platform as a link to the projectâ€™s pull request on GitHub.
Algorithm of actions:
Develop a controller, a service, and some kind of shopping cart entity.
When calling the add method, you can pass one or more numbers as request parameters, which are the ID of a certain product.
When we get, we should get all the added IDs as a list in JSON format.
For each connection of a new client, a new object must be created - a basket.
There should be no storage of all baskets.
As a test, you can log in from your browser and add items, then get a list.
